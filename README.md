The TrackAsia Gestures for Android library wraps [GestureDetectorCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/GestureDetectorCompat.html) and introduces implementation of scale, rotate, move, shove and tap gesture detectors. TrackAsia Gestures for Android was inspired by [Android Gesture Detector Framework](https://github.com/Almeros/android-gesture-detectors) and offers the same functionality with some additional features on top.

This is a dependency of [TrackAsia Native for Android](https://github.com/track-asia/trackasia-native/tree/main/platform/android#readme).
